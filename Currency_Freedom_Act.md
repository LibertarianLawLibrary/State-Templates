## Overview

This document outlines the "Currency Freedom Act," a legislative template designed to protect individual economic liberties by removing legal tender laws, recognizing any form of currency chosen by individuals, and prohibiting the use of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Additionally, it bars the state from imposing taxes on the exchange of currencies.

## Interpretation

- **Legal Tender and Currency Choice:** The Act repeals all state laws that mandate the use of specific legal tender in transactions. Individuals and businesses within the state are free to use any form of currency, including cryptocurrencies, precious metals, and other assets, as agreed upon by the parties involved.

- **Taxation on Currency Exchanges:** The Act prohibits the state from imposing any taxes, fees, or penalties on the exchange of one form of currency for another, ensuring that individuals can freely trade currencies without financial burdens imposed by the state.

- **Ban on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs):** The Act explicitly bans the issuance, use, or acceptance of CBDCs within the state. This provision protects against federal overreach and ensures that the state's citizens retain control over their financial privacy and economic transactions.

- **Economic Freedom Protection:** The Act includes safeguards to prevent any future legislation or policy from infringing on the economic freedoms of individuals. It emphasizes the importance of non-coercive economic activities and free markets.

## Implementation

State authorities are required to review and repeal any existing laws that conflict with the principles laid out in this Act. Enforcement agencies are instructed to uphold the provisions of this Act and ensure that no laws are applied that contradict its intent.
