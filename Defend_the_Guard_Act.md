## Overview

This document outlines the "Defend the Guard Act," a legislative template designed to prevent the unauthorized deployment of National Guard members into combat zones or foreign nations without a formal declaration of war by Congress. The Act reinforces state sovereignty, constitutional adherence, and provides additional protections for National Guard members.

## Interpretation

- **Restriction on Deployment:** The Act prohibits the deployment of National Guard units into combat zones or foreign nations unless there is a formal declaration of war by Congress. Orders from the federal government or the President without such a declaration are considered unlawful.

- **Protection of National Guard Members:** The Act provides robust protections for National Guard members, including legal support, protection from retribution, and access to counseling services if they refuse to participate in unlawful deployments.

- **Enforcement and Legal Recourse:** The Attorney General is tasked with overseeing the implementation of the Act, ensuring compliance, and taking legal action against any federal attempts to violate its provisions.

## Implementation

The Attorney General is responsible for ensuring that National Guard members are not unlawfully deployed and that all protections under the Act are enforced. The Act takes effect immediately upon its passage and approval by the Governor.

# [State Name] Defend the Guard Act

## Preamble

Whereas the Constitution of the United States vests the power to declare war solely in the Congress, as outlined in Article I, Section 8;

Whereas the unauthorized and unconstitutional deployment of National Guard units by the President undermines the principles of federalism, infringes upon the sovereignty of states, and jeopardizes the lives and well-being of Guard members;
