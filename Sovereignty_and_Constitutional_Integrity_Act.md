## Overview

This document outlines the "Sovereignty and Constitutional Integrity Act," a legislative template designed to protect state sovereignty by halting state funding for federal agencies not explicitly authorized by the U.S. Constitution. It also mandates the transfer of all property of such agencies within the state to the state government, with the property to be sold, converted to Bitcoin, and the proceeds distributed equally among all state residents.

## Interpretation

- **Prohibition of Funding:** The Act requires the state to cease all funding and cooperation with federal agencies not explicitly authorized by the U.S. Constitution. This includes ending any existing contracts or agreements with such entities.

- **Review and Termination of Agreements:** The Attorney General is tasked with reviewing all current state expenditures and agreements to ensure compliance. Any agreement that supports unconstitutional federal entities must be terminated immediately.

- **Transfer and Sale of Federal Property:** All federal property associated with unconstitutional agencies within the state must be transferred to state ownership. This property is then to be sold, with the proceeds converted into Bitcoin and equally distributed among all state residents.

- **Protection of State Sovereignty:** The Act affirms the state's commitment to protecting its sovereignty and resisting federal encroachment on powers reserved to the states or the people.

## Implementation

State authorities are required to ensure that no state funds or resources are used to support unconstitutional federal entities. The State Treasurer and other relevant officials are responsible for managing the sale of federal property, conversion to Bitcoin, and distribution of proceeds to residents.
