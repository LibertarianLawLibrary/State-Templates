## Overview

This document outlines the "Educational Freedom and Autonomy Act," a legislative template designed to end state cooperation with the federal Department of Education, abolish compulsory education laws, and restructure the state's education system to maximize parental choice and educational diversity. The Act also mandates the closure of all state-run school systems within five years and encourages collaboration among parents, entrepreneurs, and local communities to develop alternative educational options.

## Interpretation

- **Termination of Cooperation:** The Act requires the state to cease all cooperation with the federal Department of Education, giving the state full autonomy over its educational policies.

- **Restructuring Education:** Compulsory education laws are abolished, and parents are given full freedom to choose whether and how their children are educated. The state will create an open system of educational institutions with no geographic or district restrictions.

- **Closure of State-Run Schools:** All state-run school systems will be permanently closed within five years of the passage of the Act. The state will provide resources and guidance to facilitate the transition, and will encourage parents, entrepreneurs, and local communities to create and expand private, alternative, and community-based educational options.

- **End of State Aid to Private Schools:** State aid and financial support to private schools will be terminated, ensuring these institutions operate independently and free from state control.

## Implementation

The State Department of Education, or its equivalent, is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act, ensuring the complete withdrawal from federal mandates and the restructuring of the state's education system. The Act takes effect immediately upon its passage and approval by the Governor.
