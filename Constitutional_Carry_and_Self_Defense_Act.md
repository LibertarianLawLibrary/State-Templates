# [State Name] Constitutional Carry and Self-Defense Act

## Preamble

Whereas the right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and is essential to the preservation of individual liberty and self-defense;

Whereas James Madison stated, "The advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition," highlighting the importance of an armed populace as a defense against tyranny;

Whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote, "The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government," emphasizing the role of firearms in safeguarding liberty against governmental overreach;

Whereas Patrick Henry declared, "Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined," underscoring the necessity of force, including the right to bear arms, to maintain freedom and resist tyranny;

Whereas the phrase "shall not be infringed" in the Second Amendment signifies an absolute and unequivocal prohibition on any governmental action that seeks to restrict, limit, or interfere with the right to keep and bear arms in any form;

Whereas any regulation or infringement upon the right to keep and bear arms undermines the fundamental principles of freedom and the ability of individuals to protect themselves, their families, and their property;
