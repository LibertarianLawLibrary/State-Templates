# [State Name] Liberty Preservation and Protest Act

## Preamble

Whereas the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution affirm the rights of the people beyond those explicitly enumerated in the Constitution and reserve all powers not delegated to the federal government to the states and the people;

Whereas the American forefathers engaged in multiple acts of tax protest, including the Boston Tea Party and resistance to the Stamp Act, as a means of defending their liberties against government overreach and tyranny;

Whereas the right to protest against government actions that infringe upon individual liberties, overspend public resources, or engage in tyrannical behavior is a fundamental aspect of a free society;
